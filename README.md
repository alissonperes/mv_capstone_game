## How to play

The main objective of this game is for the king to collect his treasure. Each new round will spawn crystals, dragons and bombs. The bombs are the only killers here, so run from them. The dragons wont kill the king, just take away his points, but don't fear, the king can slay the dragon with his mighty strength.

To move the King, it's as simple as pressing the arrow keys.

- ↑ Up to jump
- ↓ Down while on air to fall faster
- ← Left to move left
- → Right to move right

To attack just press the space key.

Have fun playing. Any feedback will be appreciated.

## Live Version

There are two live versions, on my personal website (hosted in the US) and on githack (not sure where they are hosted). You could try to play on either links, just be advised that the score is stored on local storage for the website you use to play, so if you change the page, your score could be reset, but the high score is still saved with an API.
